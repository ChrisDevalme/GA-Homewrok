          <span>What is the Document Object Model (DOM) and how is it represented in a web browser?</span>
          <span class="ans">A Document Object Model (DOM) tree is a hierarchical representation of an HTML or XML document. It consists of a root node, which is the document itself, and a series of child nodes that represent the elements, attributes, and text content of the document.</span>
        </li>

        <li>
          <span>How can you select an element with the ID 'unique-element' using JavaScript?</span>
          <span class="ans">To get an element by id in javascript, we can use the getElementById() inbuilt function to get any HTML element simply by providing their id tag.</span>
        </li>

        <li>
          <span>Describe how to change the text content of a paragraph element using JavaScript.</span>
          <span class="ans">The easiest way to modify the content of an HTML element is by using the innerHTML property.</span>
        </li>

        <li>
          <span>What is the difference between innerHTML and textContent properties?</span>
          <span class="ans">Both the innerText and innerHTML properties let you access and change the contents of a tag. innerText returns the text without any descendants or spacing. innerHTML returns the text including any descendants and spacing. </span>
        </li>

        <li>
          <span>Explain how to add a new class to an HTML element using JavaScript.</span>
          <span class="ans">In JavaScript, you can add a class to an HTML element with the classList property. You can use the add() method to add a class to the classList property.</span>
        </li>

        <li>
          <span>How can you attach an onclick event to a button with JavaScript?</span>
          <span class="ans">In HTML, we can use the onclick attribute and associate it with a JavaScript function. For greater flexibility, we can also use JavaScript's addEventListener() method and pass a click event to it.</span>
        </li>

        <li>
          <span>Describe the steps to remove an element from the DOM.</span>
          <span class="ans">The Node .remove() method lets you remove an element from the DOM. Call it on the element you want to remove.

        <li>
          <span>What is event propagation and how can you stop it?</span>
          <span class="ans">The stopPropagation() method prevents propagation of the same event from being called. Propagation means bubbling up to parent elements or capturing down to child elements.</span>
        </li>

        <li>
          <span>How do you change the style of an element, for example, to make the text color red using JavaScript?</span>
          <span class="ans">Use element.style property to set the style attribute of an element. Set the properties either by using bracket notation or dash notation.</span>

          </span>
          <span class="ans">Hide elements in HTML using display property - GeeksforGeeks
            The style display property is used to hide or show the content of HTML DOM by accessing the DOM element using JavaScript/jQuery. To hide an element, set the style display property to “none”. </span>
